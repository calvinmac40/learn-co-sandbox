where user types in chow_now_cli
Normally a user would search for a recipe based on a food type i.e. beef, seafood chicken etc. in a search engine which would return numerous websites. The user then picks a website that would list the recipes. The user picks a recipe that looks at the delicious picture, reads the ratings, descriptions and maybe even the reviews. After all of this effort the user clicks on the recipe directions and notices that she does not have 30 minutes of prep time and 1 hour of cooking time to get the meal prepared for dinner or even worse the user does not have the  ingredients for the recipe! This CLI will eliminate that problem by providng the user with that information earlier in the process.

   1.Beef Wellington
   <!--  Beef Wellington will return the recipe which also contains the description -->
   
    Description 
    Perfect Beef Wellington! Beef tenderloin fillet, coated with mustard, mushroom duxelles, ham, wrapped in puff pastry and baked. Based on Gordon Ramsay Beef Wellington recipe.
    Ingredients
    1 pound beef tenderloin filet
    Salt and pepper
    Extra virgin olive oil
    1 pound mushrooms (we used half cremini, half shiitake)
    4 thin slices ham (Parma ham if you can get it) or prosciutto
    2 tablespoons yellow mustard (we used Coleman's Original English Mustard)
    7 ounces puff pastry (needs 3 hours to defrost in refrigerator if using frozen)
    2 egg yolks, beaten
    Recipe
    1 Sear filet on all sides: Season the fillet generously with salt and pepper. Heat a tablespoon or two of oil in a large pan on high heat. Sear the fillet in the pan on all sides until well browned (hint: do not move the fillet until it has had a chance to brown).
    2 Brush the filet with mustard: Remove the filet from the pan and let cool. Once cooled, brush the fillet on all sides with mustard.
    3 Prepare the mushroom duxelles: Chop the mushrooms and put them into a food processor and purée. Heat the sauté pan on medium high heat. Transfer the mushroom purée into the pan and cook, allowing the mushrooms to release their moisture.
    When the moisture released by the mushrooms has boiled away, remove the mushrooms from the pan and set aside to cool. Etc........
